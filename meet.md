<hr />

As we're not together. But one day, we'll make a plan to meet each other🤗. I don't know,  when will that day come ? After a month, year or decade (too long, lol😆)? But, I'm sure that day will surely come. 

One morning , I'll wake up just to meet you. You'll gotta see my face and I'll gotta see your face that day. I'm damn sure that We'll surely have marvelous time together that day. We'll go to the cafe. We'll eat too much (like bhukkads 😆) and party together.

I know people change with time, we'll see so many changes in each other, surly few changes that we never expected. As we were close friends , each is gonna miss another. (I'm missing 😓 you badly and surely you'll be missing me, little bit).

Maybe one day we’ll meet again when we’re different people. Maybe then we’ll be better for each other. 

But I'll not be enough changed to admit that i missed you or i still love you. Even if i did, i know that you will know the truth by just looking into my eyes 😻, after all you have an special ability to read my mind just looking into my eyes😳.

Anyways, As I'll hug you into my arms, you'll listen to my heartbeats 💓 and get to know that it is still beating for someone named Chamki .

Waiting for that day. Wait for me !

❤😘❤
