As we're not together. But one day, we'll make a plan (may be a surprise meeting instead of plan😆) to meet each other🤗. I don't know,  when will that day come ? After a month, year or decade (too long, lol😆) But I'm sure that day will surely come. 

One morning🌄, I'll wake up just to meet you. You'll gotta see my face and I'll gotta see your face that day. I'm damn sure that We'll surely have marvelous time together that day. We'll go to the cafe. We'll eat too much (like bhukkads 😆) and party together.

I know people change with time, we'll see so many changes in each other, surly few changes that we never expected. As we were close friends , each is gonna miss another. (I'm missing 😓 you badly and surely you'll be missing me, little bit😉).

Maybe one day we’ll meet again when we’re different people. Maybe then we’ll be better for each other. May be then things will happen perfectly between us.

But I'll not be enough changed to admit that i missed you or i still love you. Even if i did, i know that you will know the truth by just looking into my eyes 😻, after all you have an special ability to read my mind just looking into my eyes😳

Anyways, That day, I'm gonna hug you into my arms (Maybe 😆). You'll listen to my heartbeats 💓 and get to know that it is still beating for someone named chamki . Relax, It'll be all formal. No need to worry !

We're maintaining distance for each other's happiness. You don't want me to be a devdaas 😆 and Also, i can feel that you aren't happy with me and my daily arguments/lectures. So, having a distance is necessary for us. This waiting period is surely going to be heart wrecking 💔 for me. I'm not like your ex-boyfriend who looked for another girl while being apart. Kindaa, his true love, right ? Whatever, I'm yours forever. No girl can snatch me from you. 😘 

I truly loved , I never treated you like an object. I didn't choose you for the way you look. I'm kind of person who never pick out a book just because the cover looks nice but gives the time to read what's inside. Same was in your case. Little bit of physical affection is obvious but it wasn't attraction at all. I am emotionally attached to you. I discussed all real feelings to you. Each day, i can’t stop thinking about you. I am possessive and only desired for you. It is all deep romantic love, though u couldn't understand it. But, Umm 😓, some true love stories are never meant to complete. Whatever ! No regrets.

Even If you start liking someone else in this time, then be frank this time 🙏 and please don't hesitate to tell it to me. Your feelings always matters. For the sake of my feelings, I'll not force you to have feelings for me. You always deserve better, better person than me, my queen👰

I'm kind of person who will be happy for you and feel proud of your bitter truths instead of sweet lies. I just want you to be happy ☺ even if it is without me or with someone else. 

Anyways, If you stays and wait for me, that will be supercool ☺

Life is all about up's and down's. If we meet then it'll be just amazing time and here i'm waiting for that wonderful day🔥. Even if we never meet, there is no such thing to regret as you have already given me a lot of lovely and irreplaceable memories in my life.

❤🙏
