If someday you have a soft corner for me or start liking me 💗. Then, May be we can give a chance to our relationship 💑. We can go out for a date. But, before all that, **I want you to know a few things about me. Few things you already know and few you don't. 👇**



+ I won't try to impress you when we are on date. If I try to impress you, I will definitely loose originality. So I will be myself. You can feel the rawness without any sugar-coated behaviour. I expect same thing from you. 🙈
+ I don't have many friends. So, I can give a lot of time to you. 
+ If I don't like anything about you, I can say it on your face and I expect the same thing from you. Let's be transparent like water with our opinions. 
+ I'm straight forward 🤘 and trustworthy. So, yeah we can share secrets without any hesitation ✌
+ I don't know much cooking. I can cook 🍽 fried rice and a few things. But, we can spend our time in kitchen. We can be each other's mentor in cooking. You don't know cooking. So, We can open YouTube and learn cooking online together.😊
+ I'm not a great singer, but I have a few friends with soothing voice. Even, I can sing for you. 🎤
+ I'm 5′10″. So, you can hug me perfectly as you are around 5′5″😍 I'll not mind even If you were taller, then you can remove your heel sandals 🤔😂.
+ I'm not way too intelligent,🙇 but I have qualified a few tough competitive exams (including csir'J-18, Jam'17, Sau'17 etc. and preparing for Gate'19 and Gre'19) in very first attempt and I have basic common sense too. 😅
+ I like to hug 🤗 you from behind and kiss on your cheeks.😘
+ I prefer kissing 💑 on your forehead than on your lips on our first date, but be ready to get a mark of love bite on your lips if we meet second time 😘

+ I love classic comedy and romantic movies over action movies. I love peace. ✌
+ I can treat you like an angel for a moment 👰 and the very next moment I never give a f**k about you 💁. So, be ready to tolerate my fickle mindedness. 😇
+ Sometimes, I use "F" words 🤬. But, It doesn't mean that I don't have manners or I don't respect others.
+ I have a dual/ split personality. A social, funny a.s.a silent side and an evil 👿 , moody side 😇. So, you can enjoy dating 2 persons in me.
+ I prefer “Ladies first” rule, that doesn't make me gentleman. It's just because I can stare you from behind for a long time. Men will be men 😅

+ I have good reading and writing skills (luckily). So, you can expect handwritten romantic letters 📜 with chocolate bars🍫 occasionally.
+ I'm a retro type outdated fashion fellow. Usually, can be seen in formals. But, We can go for shopping of latest fashionable stuffs 🎩

+ I love traditional girl for dating over modern torn jeans girl. 🙋
+ I love girl who wear less makeup for dating over girl wearing lots of makeup. 🙍🙅
+ I have allergy from strong smelling perfumes. 😷 I start sneezing with that strong smell 🤕. Make sure, you don't use them. But, you can use low concentrated deodorants. ☺
+ I prefer bracelets over wrist watches. I'm bored of wrist watches. Make sure you don't gift wrist watch on my birthday. I don't wear them at all. 
+ I'm very short tempered😤. So, you have to take care of my anger. But, I cool down very soon.😌
+ I'm not your ex. I'm different person. So, don't expect his each and every good quality in me. But, yeah you can frankly tell me all those things, i should work on. 🙈
+ I may not open the door of cab for you. But yeah, I'll walk vehicle side, holding your hand 👫 while i'm with you.

+ I forgive soon and forget very soon ☺
+ I look innocent but I have a devil mind.😈
+ If I see your bra strips outside of your dress, I will text you saying that instead of telling you in public, but in private, sorry I can't help you out 😜🙆
+ I'm not a photogenic. So, we can take pics for memories 📸 instead of taking pics to post it on instagram or facebook. 
+ I know a few native languages, brij-bhasa, haryanvi and punjabi (little bit). So, sometimes, you can get bouncer of few desi words. 😇
+ I'm not a conversational wizard but I'll make sure that our conversation remains interesting. ✌
+ I'm not very rich (Ambani ki aulad type 😂) but I can take you to a good restaurant or a good sensational movie.
+ I'm interested in kabaddi, cricket and football. But, you can get hold on TV remote 📺 and I can check scores on my phone.📱
+ We can plan to go on a unplanned destination on weekends🚣. It will be fun. Planning kills enthusiasm.
+ I believe that someday I'll be popular within my field of interests. So, you can see the glimpse of future conquerer in me. 😎



**So, Let's plan for a meeting and start the conversation with mugs of coffee 😍**
