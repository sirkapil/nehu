**What if i got a chance to 
teach group theory to a bunch 
of niggas ! Listen up Noobs !!**

_Girls :_ cyclic group (except 
prime order)

_Chick Hunters:_ Special type 
of abelian groups.

_Real Men :_ Simple Group (
 non-abelian and higher orders)

_falling in love :_ Group Homomorphism


>**Intresting  thing is : **Cyclic groups expect unique trivial homo from abelian groups  and point fingers at simple groups for multiple non-trivial homo.

That's why simple groups are _so simple_ , Abelian Groups are so _commutative_ and cyclic one's are_ too much cyclic !_
